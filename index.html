            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">My name is Shivani Jha, and I'm from Bihar. I am now pursuing a
                bachelor's degree in computer science engineering at Chandigarh University. My problem is that I cannot
                refuse someone when he or she requests assistance in moving forward since I dislike easily believing in
                anybody. My short-term aim is to join a reputable firm where I can apply my skills and expertise for the
                benefit of the company and where I will be exposed to a learning environment.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
                Music is one of the most important and powerful things in my life. My life without melodies and harmonies would be totally empty. Listening to and playing different tunes helps me to de-stress, relax and it can also help to motivate me in trying times.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
                Dance has always been a big part of my life since I was a small child. My mother enrolled me in dance lessons when I was five years old, never expecting it to lead to anything serious. Dancing was a side interest I did after school for a year to keep me busy. Despite the fact that dancing was a lot of pleasure for me.

            <h1>Drawing</h1>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
                My hobby is drawing. I enjoy painting because it allows me to forget about my worries and fills me with intriguing questions. When I'm drawing an eagle's wings, for example, I have a lot of questions, such as why its wings are so large and curled upwards at the edge. It allows me to expand my creativity and utilise my ideas in whatever manner I choose without limitations.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> 
                I've been on many amazing vacations throughout my life. Every year, I look forward to my family's yearly vacation to Georgia, and I'll never forget our trip to Graceland or all of the other family gatherings we've attended out east. But the one trip that has stuck with me and had the most influence on me was not a family vacation.</p>
